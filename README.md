# MultiPing NG

MultiPing NG is a Python-based network monitoring tool that continuously checks the connectivity of multiple hosts. It performs both ICMP (ping) tests and TCP port tests concurrently, then displays the results in a live-updating, color-coded terminal dashboard.

## Features

- **Concurrent Testing:** Uses a thread pool to run multiple network tests in parallel.
- **ICMP and TCP Tests:** Supports both ping tests (ICMP) and TCP port connection tests.
- **Customizable Test History:** Maintains a fixed-length history of test results to visualize performance over time.
- **Live Terminal Dashboard:** Clears and updates the terminal screen continuously with real-time test statuses.
- **Color-Coded Output:** Utilizes ANSI escape sequences to highlight statuses (e.g., red for DOWN, yellow for slow responses).

## Requirements

- **Python 3**  
- **PyYAML:** For parsing the YAML configuration file. Install using pip:

  ```bash
  pip install pyyaml
  ```

- **Standard Libraries:** The script uses modules such as `sys`, `os`, `socket`, `time`, `subprocess`, `re`, `ipaddress`, and `concurrent.futures` which are included in the Python standard library.

## Usage

1. **Prepare the Configuration File:**  
   Create a YAML file (e.g., `config.yaml`) that specifies the hosts and tests. A sample configuration might look like this:

   ```yaml
   ignore_self: true
   hosts:
     - "192.168.1.1":
         description: "Router"
         tests:
           - protocol: "ICMP"
     - "192.168.1.100":
         description: "Web Server"
         tests:
           - protocol: "TCP"
             port: 80
           - protocol: "TCP"
             port: "8000-8002"
   ```

   In this example, the script will:
   - Ping the host at `192.168.1.1`.
   - For the host at `192.168.1.100`, perform a TCP connection test on port 80 and a range of ports from 8000 to 8002.
   - Ignore the local host IP in case it is found in the list. This is useful in case you want to copy paste the same file in multiple hosts that should test each other

2. **Run the Script:**  
   Ensure the script is executable. You can set the executable permission with:

   ```bash
   chmod +x new_pinger.py
   ```

   Then run the script with the configuration file as an argument:

   ```bash
   ./new_pinger.py config.yaml
   ```

   The script will continuously update the terminal with the latest network test results.

## How It Works

1. **Configuration Loading:**  
   The script reads a YAML configuration file to load host details and test parameters. Each host must be provided with a valid IP address and an optional description. If no test is defined, it defaults to an ICMP test.

2. **Testing Logic:**  
   - **ICMP Tests:** Uses the system's `ping` command with a 1-second timeout to determine if a host is reachable and measures the average round-trip time.
   - **TCP Tests:** Attempts to create a socket connection to the specified port(s) with a short timeout. The latency is calculated based on the connection time.
   - Both tests update a history array with symbols representing the status (e.g., a dot for success or an "X" for failure).

3. **Display:**  
   The results for each host and each test are displayed in organized columns showing:
   - Test type (ICMP or TCP with port)
   - Current status (latency or DOWN)
   - A history chart representing recent test results
   - A timestamp for the last time the host was seen as up

4. **Continuous Monitoring:**  
   The script loops indefinitely, updating the test results every second, and cycling through the history index to maintain a fixed-length record of recent statuses.

## Limitations

- **System Dependencies:** The script relies on the availability of the `ping` command and appropriate permissions to execute it.
- **ICMP Restrictions:** Some systems or networks may block ICMP traffic, which could affect test results.
- **Timeout Settings:** The short timeout values (0.5 seconds) may not be suitable for all network environments; adjust as necessary.
